	<h3>About this website</h3>
	<p>
	Hi there! I am a PhD candidate at Wageningen University, the Netherlands. Currently I live in Berlin. My research interests are uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in environmental modelling. Recently, I handed in my PhD thesis <em>An uncertain climate: the value of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment of food</em>. On this website, you can find the <a href="/introduction/Introduction.html">introduction</a>, <a href="/discussion/Discussion.html">discussion</a> and <a href="/summary/Summary.html">summarys</a> of my thesis.  </p>
	<p>  I will use this website to distribute matlab code for performing uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in 			environmental impact assessment models, which I used in some of my <a href="/papers/overview.html">recent publications</a> that were included in my PhD thesis.</p>
