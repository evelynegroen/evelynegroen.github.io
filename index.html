	<h3>About this website</h3>
		
	<p> Hi there! </p> 
	    
	<p> I am interested in data analysis, error propagation, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis of mathematical models. Recently, I succesfully defended my PhD thesis <em>An uncertain climate: the value of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment of food</em> at Wageningen University, the Netherlands. My PhD research focussed on the effect of correlation during uncertainty propagation on the variance of the model output. On this website, you can find the <a href="/introduction/Introduction.html">Introduction</a>, <a href="/discussion/Discussion.html">Discussion</a> and <a href="/summary/Summary.html">Summary</a> of my thesis.  </p>
	<p>  In addition, I will use this website to distribute <b>MatLab</b> and <b>Python</b> code for performing uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis, which were used in my <a href="/papers/overview.html"> publications</a>.</p>
