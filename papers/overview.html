    	<p><font size ="2">Life cycle assessment (LCA) calculates the environmental impact of a product over its entire life 			cycle. Uncertainty analysis in LCA is usually performed using Monte Carlo sampling. In this study, Monte Carlo sampling, 		Latin hypercube sampling, quasi Monte Carlo sampling, analytical uncertainty propagation and fuzzy interval arithmetic were 		compared based on e.g. convergence rate and output statistics. Each method was tested on three LCA case studies, which 			differed in size and behaviour. Uncertainty propagation in LCA using a sampling method leads to more (directly) usable 			information compared to fuzzy interval arithmetic or analytical uncertainty propagation. Latin hypercube and quasi Monte 		Carlo sampling provide more accuracy in determining the sample mean than Monte Carlo sampling and can even converge faster 			than Monte Carlo sampling for some of the case studies discussed in this paper.</font> </p>

		<p> <font size ="2">Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an established tool to quantify the environmental impact of a product. A good assessment of uncertainty is important for making well-informed decisions in comparative LCA, as well as for correctly prioritising data collection efforts. Under- or overestimation of output uncertainty (e.g. output variance) will lead to incorrect decisions in such matters. The presence of correlations between input parameters during uncertainty propagation, can increase or decrease the the output variance. However, most LCA studies that include uncertainty analysis, ignore correlations between input parameters during uncertainty propagation, which may lead to incorrect conclusions. Two approaches to include correlations between input parameters during uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis were studied: an analytical approach and a sampling approach. The use of both approaches is illustrated for an artificial case study of electricity production. Results demonstrate that both approaches yield approximately the same output variance and sensitivity indices for this specific case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the analytical approach can be used to quantify the risk of ignoring correlations between input parameters during uncertainty propagation in LCA. We demonstrate that: (1) we can predict if including correlations among input parameters in uncertainty propagation will increase or decrease output variance; (2) we can quantify the risk of ignoring correlations on the output variance and the global sensitivity indices. Moreover, this procedure requires only little data</font></p>

	<p><font size ="2">Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of food products, such as dairy, require many input parameters that are affected by variability and uncertainty. Moreover, correlations may be present between input parameters, e.g. between feed intake and milk yield. The purpose of this study was to identify which input parameters are essential to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of milk production, while accounting for correlations between input parameters. First, a local sensitivity analysis was used to identify which parameters influence GHG emissions most. Second, a global sensitivity analysis was used to identify which parameters are most important to the output variance. The global analysis included correlations between feed intake and milk yield and between N-fertilizer rates and crop yields. The local and global sensitivity analyses were combined to determine which parameters are essential. Finally, we analysed the effect of changing the most important correlation coefficient (between feed intake and milk yield) on the output variance and global sensitivity analysis.</font></p>

    	<p> <font size ="2">This study aimed to identify the most essential input parameters in the assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along the pork production chain. We identified most essential input parameters by combining two sensitivity-analysis methods: the multiplier method and the method of elementary effects. The former shows how much an input parameter influences assessment of GHG emissions, whereas the latter shows the importance of input parameters on uncertainty in the output. For the method of elementary effects, uncertainty ranges were implemented only for input parameters that were identified as being most influential based on the multiplier method or that had large uncertainty ranges based on the literature. Combining two types of sensitivity-analysis methods identified the most essential input parameters in the pork production chain. With this combined analysis, mitigation options via innovations and management strategies were derived, and parameters were identified that improved reliability of the results.</font></p>
