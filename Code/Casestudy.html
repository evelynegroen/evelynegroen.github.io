<h4>Case studies in environmental impact assessment models </h4>
<p>There are two kind of <a href="/introduction/Introduction.html">environmental impact assessment models</a> studied in this thesis: <b>life cycle assessment</b> and <b>nutrient use efficiency</b>. For each model, a (simplified) case study is given as an illustration. For both case studies, their matrix-based equivalents are used, to facilitate the implementation of the methods for uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis later on.
</p>
<h6>Case study in matrix-based life cycle assessment </h6>
<p>All methods for uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis are applied to an (renowned) case study, first introduced by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9"> Heijungs and Suh [2002]</a>. The case study respresents the production of electricity, but is a drastic simplification. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the case study. </p>

      <p>Figure 1: Production of 1 MWh electricity, the case study is taken from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9"> Heijungs and Suh [2002]</a>. The numbers 1 to 6 represent the flows, flow 3 is equal to zero in this example. <em>Source:</em> General Introduction PhD thesis Evelyne Groen <em>"An uncertain climate: the value of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment of food"</em>, 2016.</p>
