<h4>Case studies in environmental impact assessment models </h4>
<p>There are two kind of <a href="/introduction/Introduction.html">environmental impact assessment models</a> studied in this thesis: <b>life cycle assessment</b> and <b>nutrient balance analysis</b>. For each model, a (simplified) case study is given as an illustration. For both case studies, their matrix-based equivalents are used, to facilitate the implementation of the methods for uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis later on.
</p>
<h6>1. Case study in matrix-based life cycle assessment </h6>
<p>All methods for uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis are applied to an (renowned) case study, first introduced by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9"> Heijungs and Suh [2002]</a>. The case study respresents the production of electricity, but is a drastic simplification. <b>Figure 1</b> shows a flow diagram of the case study. </p>

      <p><small><b>Figure 1</b>: Production of 1 MWh electricity, the case study is taken from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9"> Heijungs and Suh [2002]</a>. The numbers 1 to 6 represent the flows, flow 3 is equal to zero in this example. <em>Source:</em> Chapter 4 PhD thesis Evelyne Groen <em>"An uncertain climate: the value of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment of food"</em>, 2016.</small></p>

<p>The flows 1 to 6 in <b>Figure 1</b> represent: (1): 10 kWh electricity; (2): 2 liter diesel; (3) 0 kWh electricity (there is no electricity used during the production of diesel); (4) 100 liter diesel; (5) 1 kg CO<sub>2</sub>; (6) 10 kg CO<sub>2</sub>.  </p>

<p>The flow diagram can be converted to a matrix-based format containing two matrices: an <b>A</b>-matrix containing the production processes (flow 1 to 4) and a <b>B</b>-matrix containing the emissions (flow 5 and 6). For a complete introduction I would like to refer you to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9"> Heijungs and Suh [2002]</a>.  In case of a total demand of 1000 kWh electricity, the total emissions equal 120 kg CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
