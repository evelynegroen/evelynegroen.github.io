<h4>Discussion</h4>
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p>
The challenge to produce food in an environmentally friendly way has be- come urgent [Steinfeld et al., 2006; Gerber et al., 2013]. To develop strategies to produce food with a low environmental impact, environmental assessment models are developed that quantify the total environmental impact associated with food production, such as life cycle assessment or nutrient balance analysis. Input data required for these environmental impact assessment models, however, may vary due to seasonal changes, geographical conditions or socio-economic factors (natural variability) Moreover, input data may be uncertain, due to measurement errors and observational errors that exist around modeling of emissions and technical parameters (epistemic uncertainty). Although agricultural activities and food production are prone to natural variability and epistemic uncertainty, very few case studies made a thorough examination of the effects of variability and uncertainty on the result.
</p>
<p>
The aim of this thesis was to enhance understanding the effects of vari- ability and uncertainty on the results. This was done by exploring how uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis can help to reduce the efforts for data collection, support the development of mitigation strategies and improve overall reliability, leading to more informed decision-making in environmental impact assessment models. To that end, methods for uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis were combined, and the effect of correlations in uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis were explicitly accounted for. To be able to formulate case study specific suggestions that could improve reliability and point to potential mitigation strategies in food production, methods were applied to case studies of dairy and pork production.</p>
<p>
This chapter starts with discussing the value of uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment models, followed by the value of matrix notation. Subsequently, recommendation of the use of methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are given. This chapter ends with an overview of the conclusions.</p>

<h6>Local sensitivity analysis</h6>
<p>
Local sensitivity analysis in environmental impact assessment models, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and nutrient balance (NB) analysis, are generally performed using a one-at-a-time (OAT) approach. An OAT approach takes a parameter, increases it e.g. 5% and quantifies the effect on the model output. OAT approaches in LCA or NB analysis usually consider a subset of all available parameters, based on expert judgment or perhaps a quantitative criterion, such as the contribution of the individual input parameter to the total environmental impact. However, when the selection of the input parameters considered for the local sensitivity analysis is based on such principles, influential (technical) parameters might be overlooked. For example, efficiency parameters (e.g. replacement rate or reproductive performance) are not di- rectly related to emissions, only to their prior production processes. These subsets, therefore, might not contain all potential influential parameters. A systematic approach that considers the influence of all input parameters in LCA can only be done using the multiplier method.
</p>
<p>
In <em>[Paper under review]</em>, for example, the multiplier method was used to identify the most influential parameters in an LCA that assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of milk production. Results showed that local sensitivity analysis identified milk yield, feed intake, and the emission factor of CH4 from enteric fermentation of the cows, replacement rate and crop yields as most influential parameters in the LCA model. Moreover, previous studies performing a local sensitivity analysis using an OAT approach, overlooked influential parameters such as replacement rate and crop yields.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to LCA, no such a systematic method is yet available for matrix-based NB analysis, Currently, studies that did performed a local sensitivity analysis, performed followed an OAT approach [Suh and Yee, 2011]. Future research can focus on developing a similar approach for matrix-based NB analysis.</p>
    </p>
  <p>        
Some LCA and NB studies [Huang et al., 2013; Kim and Dale, 2002; Sayagh et al., 2010; Beltran et al., 2016], use a sensitivity analysis to refer to the effect of different modeling decisions on the model output, such as the effect of changing allocation techniques or characterization factors. An explanation might be that ISO 14044 (2006) recommends performing a sensitivity analysis, which is defined as “systematic procedures for estimating the effects of the choices made regarding methods and data on the outcome of a study” [ISO, 2006b]. This definition not only refers to data, but also to methods used in a study, which indeed could refer to different allocation methods and characterization factors. Although the effect of a methodological decision, such as the allocation method used, is very important to the model outcome and the subsequent interpretation, they should not be referred to as sensitivity analysis. Moreover, the ISO standard does not make a distinction between a local sensitivity analysis (which does not include information of the uncertainty or variability around input parameters) and a global sensitivity analysis (which does include uncertainty or variability).
</p>
  <p>
The lack of distinction between local and global sensitivity analysis, has led in some studies [Flysjö et al., 2011; Basset-Mens et al., 2005] to include information about the uncertainty of the input parameters in, what is referred to as, a sensitivity analysis. For example, Basset-Mens et al. [2005] explored the effect of an increase of 1% for some parameters, that were assumed to vary only little, and 200% for other parameters, that were assumed to vary a lot. Results in Chapter 2, for example, showed that influential parameters in an LCA study of pork production were the feed conversion ratio, CH4 emissions from manure management and crop yields, especially maize. However, pre- vious studies on this topic [Basset-Mens et al., 2005; Basset-Mens and van der Werf, 2005] included uncertainty ranges of the input parameters as well, and could therefore not comparable with the results presented in <em>[Paper under review]</em>.
</p>
<p>
Referring to modeling decisions as a sensitivity analysis or including un- certainty information in a OAT approach leads to an ambiguous definition of the terminology of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, because: (1) referring to a change in method or modeling structure has nothing to do with the intrinsic sensitivity of the model, and should therefore be given a different label, such as modeling decisions; (2) combining uncertainty information in an OAT approach belongs to the area of screening analysis, which is strictly speaking not a local sensitivity analysis [Saltelli et al., 2008; Mutel et al., 2013]. Also, if uncertainty information is included in an OAT approach, it becomes less evident what it means to mutually compare the parameters, because it does not give the influence of the input parameters to the model output, as the magnitude of the uncertainty is incorporated as well.</p>
<p>
Developing a standardized definition and method for local sensitivity analysis in LCA and NB analysis, will increase comprehensibility between studies and will enhance comparability of results.
</p>

 Uncertainty analysis
Uncertainty propagation refers to propagation of uncertainty and variability around input parameters through an environmental impact assessment model to generate output data. Uncertainty analysis refers the subsequent analysis of the generated output data, such as determining the output variance, deter- mining a confidence interval etc.
Uncertainty propagation can be done using e.g. sampling approaches or analytical approaches. In Chapter 3, three sampling approaches (i.e. Monte Carlo sampling, Latin hypercube sampling, quasi Monte Carlo sampling), one analytical approach (i.e. on the basis of a Taylor series), and one fuzzy ap- proach (i.e. fuzzy interval arithmetic) were compared, based on convergence rate and output statistics. The sampling methods led to more (directly) us- able information, compared to fuzzy interval arithmetic or analytical uncer- tainty propagation. Latin hypercube and quasi Monte Carlo sampling pro- vided more accuracy in determining the sample mean than Monte Carlo sam- pling. The Latin hypercube and quasi Monte Carlo sampling methods also
192
 
CHAPTER8. 8.2. VALUEOFUNCERTAINTY&SENSITIVITYANALYSIS
converged faster than Monte Carlo sampling for some of the case studies dis- cussed in Chapter 3. The application of the more advanced sampling meth- ods, therefore, might be less fruitful for applications in LCA, as the improve- ment mainly manifested itself in the number of runs generated. This seems less relevant in environmental impact assessment models, because the algo- rithm behind LCA and NB analysis does not require much run time. The latter depends on the specific software used and the capacity of the com- puter, nonetheless, classical Monte Carlo sampling seems a valuable sampling method to apply in LCA and NB studies.
The preference of a sampling approach versus an analytical for uncertainty propagation can depend on the amount of available information. A sampling approach requires a distribution function, including a parameter of disper- sion such as the variance. Analytical uncertainty propagation as described in Chapter 3, does not require a distribution function, but only a parameter of dispersion. When less data is available about the uncertainty or variability of the input parameters, the analytical approach will become more suitable.
In Chapter 7, for example, we used an NB to benchmark nutrient losses on farms for two different farming systems. Our aim was to explore the im- pact of measurement errors (epistemic uncertainty) on the benchmarking of farms within two different farming systems. The first farming system con- tained intensive farms, in terms of e.g. milk production per ha and purchased concentrates per cow, whereas the second system included grass-based farms, with a lower milk production per ha The distribution function and the param- eters of dispersions of parameters required to assess the NB were obtained from the literature. We assumed that the epistemic uncertainties around the N-flows were measured at different locations, using different measurement tools, and, therefore, could vary independently from each other. Uncertainty propagation could be performed using Monte Carlo sampling. The uncer- tainty analysis showed that benchmarking of concentrate-based farms was no longer possible when the epistemic uncertainty of input parameters was in- cluded, whereas including epistemic uncertainty did not affect benchmarking of grass-based farms l be benchmarked.
In Chapter 6, where we assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of milk production, a correlation was assumed between N-fertilizer application and crop yield; and between feed intake and milk production. Again, uncertainty propagation was performed using a sampling approach. We showed that, in the uncertainty analysis, the correlation between feed intake and milk produc-
193

tion decreased the output variance.
To implement a correlation coefficient between input parameters during
uncertainty propagation, as done in Chapter 6, information is needed not only on the distribution functions, but also on the correlation coefficients between input parameters. Using a sampling approach for uncertainty propagation with correlated input parameters, therefore, becomes even more data inten- sive. In Chapter 5, therefore, we demonstrated how to predict the effect of ignoring correlations in uncertainty analysis in LCA, using analytical uncer- tainty propagation. More detailed, in Chapter 5 we demonstrated that (1) we can predict if including correlations among input parameters in uncertainty propagation will increase or decrease output variance; (2) we can quantify the risk of ignoring correlations on the output variance and the global sensi- tivity indices. Moreover, this procedure requires only little data availability regarding the input parameters.
We conclude, therefore, that both sampling and analytical uncertainty propagation are indispensible in environmental impact assessment models. The analytical approach is especially useful when data is limited (e.g. only the variance of the input parameters is available). In contrast, the sampling approaches are more suitable when full knowledge is available (e.g. a distri- bution function, including a parameter of dispersion).
8.2.3 Global sensitivity analysis
A global sensitivity analysis quantifies the contribution of the variances of the individual input parameters to output variance. More specifically, a sensitiv- ity index explains how much each input parameter contributes to the output variance. For example, the squared standardized regression coefficients can be interpreted as a sensitivity index. In Chapter 4, we compared rather com- mon methods for global sensitivity analysis in LCA, namely methods based on regression or correlation approaches [Geisler et al., 2005] and key issue analysis [Heijungs, 1996], to less commonly applied methods in LCA, such as the Sobol’ method and random balance design.
The comparison of the sensitivity methods was based on four aspects: (I) sampling design, (II) output variance, (III) explained variance, and (IV) con- tribution to output variance of individual input parameters, and illustrated for two hypothetical case studies. The evaluation of the sampling design (I) relates to the computational effort of a sensitivity method. Key issue analysis
194
 
CHAPTER8. 8.2. VALUEOFUNCERTAINTY&SENSITIVITYANALYSIS
does not make use of sampling (it is an analytical approach) and was fastest, whereas the Sobol’ method had to generate two sampling matrices, and there- fore, was slowest. The total output variance (II) resulted in approximately the same output variance for each method, except for key issue analysis, which underestimated the variance, especially for high input uncertainties. The ex- plained variance (III) and contribution to variance (IV) for small input un- certainties, was optimally quantified by standardized regression coefficients and the main Sobol’ index. For large input uncertainties, Spearman corre- lation coefficients and the Sobol’ indices performed best. Therefore, it was concluded that these less commonly applied methods did not outperform the common methods. Moreover, they asked for more unconventional algorithms, and may be more cumbersome to implement compared to the more frequently used methods based on linear regression or correlation approaches. However, the use of the Sobol’ method seemed better at explaining the output variance when input uncertainties are high. Also, other studies showed that the Sobol’ method might be more useful in the impact assessment model [Cucurachi et al., 2014]. Also, when the impact on the environment is quantified such as for toxicity, which contains potential non-linear relations [Posthuma et al., 2002] the Sobol’ method might become more useful. If future environmental impact assessment studies become more advanced in terms of including non- linear impact assessment, the Sobol’ and random balance design methods as discussed in Chapter 4, may become more useful. Based on the results pre- sented in Chapter 3, the squared standardized regressions coefficient (or the squared correlation coefficient), is considered as the most useful proxy for a sensitivity index.
For example, in Chapter 7, where we used an NB to benchmark nutrient losses on farms for two different farming systems, a global sensitivity analysis was applied using the squared standardized regression coefficients. We found that parameters that explained most of the output variance differed between systems. For the more concentrate-based system, input of feed and output of roughage were most important, whereas for the grass-based system, the input of mineral fertilizer (or fixation) was most important. Moreover, we showed that reducing epistemic uncertainty of the most important input parameters significantly improved benchmarking results.
In Chapter 6 we identified the most important input parameters to assess the greenhouse gas emissions of milk production, for three different grazing systems. We adapted the regression-based global sensitivity analysis to allow
195
 
8.2. VALUEOFUNCERTAINTY&SENSITIVITYANALYSIS CHAPTER8.
for correlated input parameters between feed intake and milk yield; and fertil- izer rate and crop yield. We showed that the emissions factor of CH4 emission from enteric fermentation of cows, milk yield, feed intake and the emission factor of direct N2O emissions from crop cultivation, are the most important parameters for a zero grazing system. For restricted and unrestricted grazing systems, however, N2O emission factor from manure excretion during grazing becomes increasingly more important.
When comparing the results of other studies to our results, we found that e.g. Ross et al. [2014] calculated the regression coefficients, so we could only compare their results based on the ranking of the parameters, and not on how much the parameters explained. Several studies implemented regres- sion coefficients (not standardized and not squared) [Basset-Mens et al., 2009; Aktas and Bilec, 2012], or standardized regression coefficients (not squared) [Sugiyama et al., 2005; Vigne et al., 2012], or correlation coefficients (not squared) [Mattila et al., 2012; Mattinen et al., 2014; Wang and Shen, 2013] as a measure for a global sensitivity index. For example, regression or correlation coeffi- cients that are not squared, for example, cannot be mutually compared, and are therefore less suitable as a measure for a global sensitivity index. In Ta- ble 8.1, based on the case study represented in Chapter 4, the squared stan- dardized regression coefficients and the squared (Pearson) correlation coeffi- cients were compared to the standardized regression coefficients, the regres- sion coefficients and the correlation coefficient.
For example, ranking the importance of the parameters in Table 8.1, in case of the (squared) standardized regression coefficients or the (squared) cor- relation parameter 1 is most important, but when looking at the regression coefficients, parameter 5 is most important. The squared standardized re- gression coefficient or the squared correlation coefficient are the most useful proxies for a global sensitivity index, because they can be added to each other.
Currently in the ISO standard for LCA, there is no method recommended for a global sensitivity analysis. Developing a standardized definition and method for global sensitivity analysis in LCA and NB studies, will increase comprehensibility between studies and will enhance the comparison of results between studies.

  8.2.4 The value of matrix notation in environmental impact assessment models
The environmental impact assessment models described in this thesis, LCA and NB analysis, both rely on matrix notation, to facilitate the application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. In matrix notation, the production processes are described by technical parameters given in the A-matrix. The corresponding emissions (and resource use) is given in the B-matrix. One may wonder, does matrix notation have any added value for sensitivity analysis? Uncertainty propagation using Monte Carlo simulation and global sensitiv- ity analysis by means of standardized regression coefficients can also be per- formed for environmental impact models that do not make use of matrix no- tation. However, performing an analytical local sensitivity analysis that con- siders all input parameters, such as the multiplier method, applied in Chap- ter 2 and 6, requires a functional form of the impact assessment model, such as the matrix-based approach developed by [Heijungs and Suh, 2002]. Although other functional forms have been proposed [Ciroth et al., 2004; Clavreul et al., 2013] matrix notation seems to be the most straightforward approach.
197
8.2. VALUEOFUNCERTAINTY&SENSITIVITYANALYSIS CHAPTER8.
When we also consider correlations between input parameters, the alge- braic notation gives clear insight into the effect of the correlations on the un- certainty propagation (Chapter 5). Using matrix notation, it was possible to predict the effect of including correlations during uncertainty propagation on the output variance and the global sensitivity analysis. Without the matrix formulation, it would have been impossible to make a sweeping generaliza- tion towards all different kind of case studies. To facilitate sensitivity analysis, matrix notation in LCA may not be eminent to implement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, but is facilitates the algorithm implementation required to perform the methods, which otherwise would have been cumbersome to implement.
In Chapter 2 and 6, greenhouse gas emissions were calculated for pork pro- duction and milk production respectively. To quantify the greenhouse gasses for crop cultivation, manure management and enteric fermentation, equations were implemented between the technical parameters in the A-matrix (e.g. fer- tilizer applied, manure produced and feed intake) and the GHG emissions in the B-matrix. For example, for the emissions of crop cultivation, the CO2 and indirect and direct N2O emissions depended directly on the application of fertilizers and crop yield.
The aggregation level of the production process determined which param- eters showed up in the local and global sensitivity analysis. For example, in Chapter 2, we showed that CH4 emissions of manure turned out to be in- fluential However, the sensitivity analysis was modeled on the level of the total emissions, reflecting the parameters in the A and B matrix. Therefore, the influence of underlying factors determined by the type of manure storage system, such as the methane producing capacity, depending on temperature, wind speed etc., remains unknown. Further expanding crop and livestock models in LCA and NB analysis, can help to explain which underlying fac- tors are important to make better estimations regarding environmental im- pacts. Future improvements can also be made regarding implementation of non-linear relationships. For example, it was assumed that N-fertilization and crop yield were correlated. At some stage, however, one additional input of N-fertilizer will increase crop yield less than the previous unit of input, a phe- nomenon referred to as the law of diminishing returns. Therefore, a non-linear dependency, combined with a correlation factor (i.e. other circumstances, such as soil pH and humidity influence the dependency as well), might be a bet- ter representation of reality. Expanding knowledge on potential relationships
198
 
CHAPTER8. 8.3. RECOMMENDATIONS
between input parameters, establish equations to implement these relations in environmental impact assessment models, and combine these equations with correlations between input parameters, can improve further assessments using environmental impact models. If the matrix notation might need to be adapted, or expanded to allow for the extensions of livestock models and underlying relations needs to be further developed.
8.3 Recommendations for future implementation of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
8.3.1 Recommended analysis and methods
The uncertainty or sensitivity analysis to be applied depends on the ques- tion to be addressed and the available information. An overview of research questions (formulated generally) related to the type of analysis and the recom- mended method based on the results of this thesis can be found in Table 8.2.
For example, in Chapter 2, very limited data were available and we were interested in determining which input parameters were most influential. There- fore a local sensitivity analysis, using the multiplier method was applied (question A.2, Table 8.2). In addition, a global sensitivity was applied (ques- tion D.2, Table 8.2), for those parameters, which either turned out to be in- fluential, or were known to be uncertain, based on literature. In Chapter 6, full knowledge was available regarding the input parameters including corre- lations between some of the input parameters. We applied a global sensitivity analysis, to determine which parameters were most important to the output variance (question E.1 Table 8.2), which parameters could be set to a fixed value in improved data collections (question E.1, Table 8.2) and if correlations among parameters influenced the output variance (question C.3/E. Table 8.2). In Chapter 7, we studied benchmarking farms while accounting for en epis- temic uncertainties of input parameters (question B.6, Table 8.2) and identi- fying which input parameters explain most of the output variance (question C.3, Table 8.2).

  8.3.2 Combining local and global sensitivity analysis
Environmental impact assessment models, such as LCA, are based on many input parameters; therefore, it might be difficult to collect high quality data for all input parameters. A parallel implementation of local and global sensi- tivity analysis, such as in Chapter 2 and Chapter 6, gives a direct overview of the most influential (identified by a local sensitivity analysis) and important (identified by a global sensitivity analysis) model parameters. Parameters that are considered to be both influential and important, are considered to be the most essential parameters in the model, and can be used to further improve reliability or for development of mitigation strategies (Figure 8.1).

The importance of a parameter can originate from variability or epistemic uncertainty. A distinction between variability and uncertainty may in prac- tice not be straightforward. However, it facilitates directions of mitigation strategies, which can be focused on essential parameters containing natural variability, and improvement of reliability, which can be focused on essential parameters that contain epistemic uncertainties (Figure 8.1).
Examples of parameters that are important, but not influential, are N- fertilizer rates of crop cultivation (as we showed in Chapter 6). The impor- tance of these parameters is caused by, for example, variability in N-fertilizer rates between years. An example of parameters that are influential, but not important are parameters that can be estimated very accurately, for example, the production of N-fertilizers, and can for example be improved by innova- tions.
In Chapter 2, we focused on developing mitigation strategies and improv- ing reliability of results. By combining local and global sensitivity analysis the most essential input parameters for environmental impact assessment in the pork production chain can be identified. Combining the results of these two analyses allowed to derive mitigation options, either based on innovations (e.g. novel feeding strategies) or on management strategies (e.g. reducing

mortality rate), and to formulate options for improving reliability of results (e.g. decreasing epistemic uncertainties). Also reliability could be improved if data quality of the most essential parameters were improved.
In Chapter 6, we focused on improving reliability of results only. By com- bining a local and a global sensitivity analysis, parameters could be deter- mined which are essential to assess GHG of milk production, focusing only on the reliability of the results. Essential parameters are the emission factor of CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation, milk yield; DM feed intake of the dairy cows and the emission factor of direct N2O emission of crop cultivation. Future research can focus on reducing uncertainty and improving data quality of the most essential parameters.
A local and global sensitivity analysis should, therefore, be seen as com- plementary. Moreover, in most environmental impact assessment models, data availability is limited and combining local and global sensitivity anal- ysis makes sure that parameters are not overlooked.
